## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone or Download Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MediaSurgeon.git
cd MediaSurgeon
```

Or download as ZIP and extract.

### Step 2: Download Required Executables

Download the 4 required tools listed above (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, ffprobe, websocketd).

### Step 3: Place Executables in Correct Folders

Your folder structure should look like this:

```
MediaSurgeon/
├── bin/
│   ├── ffmpeg.exe          ✅ Download this
│   ├── ffprobe.exe         ✅ Download this
│   ├── websocketd.exe      ✅ Download this
│   ├── yt-dlp.exe          ✅ Download this
│   └── temp/               (create manually and grant users write permission)
├── lib/
│   ├── tailwindcss.exe     ⚠️ Optional (dev only)
│   ├── favicon.svg
│   ├── logo.svg
│   ├── video.min.js
│   ├── video-js.min.css
│   └── [site icons...]
├── sectors/
│   ├── general.js          (fallback specialist)
│   ├── pornhub.js
│   ├── xhamster.js
│   ├── xnxx.js
│   ├── xvideos.js
│   └── youporn.js
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── media_surgeon.bat       ⭐ Run this to start!
```

### Step 4: Run MediaSurgeon

**Double-click** `media_surgeon.bat`

This will:
1. Launch the web interface in your browser (`http://localhost:8080`)
2. Start the WebSocket bridge on port 8080
3. Open a command window showing real-time activity (collapsed by default)

---

## 💡 Usage

1. **Start the application** by running `media_surgeon.bat`
2. **Paste a video URL** in the web interface
3. MediaSurgeon automatically **detects the site** and uses the appropriate specialist
4. **View available formats** (resolutions, file sizes)
5. **Click download** to start extraction (a Downloads folder we be created in the root of the project)
6. **Watch progress** in real-time (fragment counts, percentage)

## 🔧 How It Works

### Architecture

```
Browser (UI)
    ↕ WebSocket
websocketd (Bridge)
    ↕ Command Line
yt-dlp + ffmpeg (Tools)
    ↕ Network
Video Platforms
```

### Specialist System

Each supported site has a custom "specialist" (JavaScript module) that:
- Provides optimized extraction commands
- Handles site-specific quirks (Cloudflare, headers, authentication)
- Maximizes success rate and video quality
- Falls back to general specialist for unknown sites

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" or "Not recognized"
- ✅ Check that all `.exe` files are in the `bin/` folder
- ✅ Don't rename the files (except tailwindcss)
- ✅ Make sure you downloaded the Windows versions

### Port 8080 Already in Use
- Close other applications using port 8080
- Or edit `media_surgeon.bat` and change `--port=8080` to another port (e.g., `--port=8081`)

### Video Extraction Fails
- Some sites have aggressive bot detection
- Try waiting a few seconds between attempts
- Check if the site structure has changed (specialists may need updates)
- Use the general specialist by editing the URL detection logic

### Download Stalls at 99%
- This is normal for fragment-based downloads
- ffmpeg is merging fragments in the background
- Wait a few seconds - it will complete (check console output)

## 🎨 Development

### Modifying Styles

If you want to customize the appearance:

1. Download `tailwindcss.exe` and place in `lib/` folder
2. Edit `lib/tailwind-input.css` with your custom styles
3. Run: `lib\tailwindcss.exe -i lib\tailwind-input.css -o lib\tailwind-output.css`
4. Refresh the browser to see changes

### Adding New Specialists

To support a new site:

1. Create a new file in `sectors/` (e.g., `newsite.js`)
2. Follow the pattern from existing specialists
3. Export default object with `id`, `domain`, and command functions
4. Import in `index.html`
